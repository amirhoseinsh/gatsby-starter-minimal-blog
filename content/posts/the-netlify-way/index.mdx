### AWS, the Solution that Became Popular
---
In early 2000s, Amazon was trying to build an e-commerce-as-a-sevice for it's clients. So they try to solve a novel problem in which anyone has it's own e-commerce
service. Another thing that Amazon try to solve was dealing with unusual peak traffic patterns especially during the holiday season. So as you can guess, we these two point
connected together, Amazon Web Service emerged.

In April 2015, Amazon.com reported AWS was profitable,
with sales of $1.57 billion in the first quarter of the year and $265 million of operating income.
Founder Jeff Bezos described it as a fast-growing <b>$5 billion business</b>; analysts described it as "surprisingly more profitable than forecast".
Amazon stock surged and this giant company became unstoppable.

### The Ideology
How this happen? It happend by chance, or there was a restrict planning?

As I mentioned in the [Painting or Programming](wwww.google.com), Amazon focus on the problem. they moved toward the main thing which many businesses had problems
about. And introduced a solution. If we look at the market size of the cloud service, we

import App from './the-chart.js'

<App/>

As we could see, the market size of <b>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</b> has been grown about 4 times since 2015.
But it's not all about IaaS. when companies need for

### Convention over Configuration
---
This paradigm is first introduced by  David Heinemeier Hansson to describe the philosophy of the Ruby on Rails web framework,
but is related to earlier ideas like the concept of "sensible defaults" and the principle of least astonishment in user interface design.
Think about Mac and Linux and the way they behave. The 'end-to-end' concept that Jobs believed in products relates to convention. When you reduce
number of decisions people should make, it will make them build more solution-centric things at their own convenience.

### The Netlify way
In Iran, young entrepreneurs try to solve none-existing problems. Besides, they offer some options that don't even count as options. For instance, when
one cafe face with growth in revenue, they extend their menu to offer more things. But it's not a delightful solution. think about starbucks or other
successful companies. you will find them that they focus on one problem and offer the best solution. They reduce your options. So you will reach to your
need as soon as possible.

In this regard, I really respect the san francisco based startup <b>Netlify</b>. They focus on solving the development problem for developers. They don't
reinvent wheel and use lambda service which is provided by AWS. they are not trying to compete with AWS. They think about convenient of developers. Some
may find it unpleasant that you could not config your system. But I think that when you offer a service that need to meet some specified need, you should
focus on them. You maybe find it helpful if you go to starbucks and they offer you delicious pizza, but it's not what you should expect. You will go there because
you need to enjoy your moment with one coffee and sitting behind your laptop focusing on your work.
