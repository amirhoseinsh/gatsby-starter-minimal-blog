### The Abstraction
---
Data and the process of it's collection marked new epoch in human's life. Many talk about data-driven strategies and try to leverage data
in their daily decisions. In this case, people may miss the importance of the processes that we could not measure.
we should notice  when we start breaking down abstractions like succeeding of a company to concrete details like KPIs, OKRs or
any other form of measurement, we would miss some of the great part of the information. There is a mistaken reasoning named Nirvana Fallacy<sup>[1]</sup> which many businesses may fall
into as they try to specify the situation.

When we talk about the <b>culture</b>, you couldn't segregate good one from bad ones. But it's not correct with tangibles. Think about sales; you could measure progress by
how much you sell to customers or measure your customer life time value because it's a concrete concept. And unfortunately, abstractions like culture is more important than concretes like selling
because the first is premise and the second is conclusion.

But what really is culture and how it'll be developed?

### Foundation
---
A startup messed up at its foundation cannot be fixed. There is a common assumption that any investors or founders have about startups. The assumption is
about rate of success about startups. They think only 90 percent of startups would succeed. And based on this assumption, many take actions and risk their
assets, hope for an invaluable result. Albeit it is true, but actually this might not be helpful. We should deep down
to the statement and detect the reason of this conclusion, otherwise we may come up with mistaken reasoning.
Actually, there is only one person out of ten would be a successful founder.
And owing to this fact that startups do not mean by one person, you make a bet on teams. And that's why foundation matter.

In my first and second experience as a founder, my company was doomed to fail from the beginning because I underestimated was the importance of foundations.
Beginnings are special, when you look at societies, they could be categorized by their states into four: Anarchy, Democracy, Dictatorship and Theocracy.
The foundation is so important that could survive the society in it's critical moments. And we you scrutinize successful societies, you may find that they start
as a dictatorship and then float to democracy. So no perfect country start with anarchy, because foundation should have their own values and anarchy wouldn't allow to
establish a great foundation. For example, George Washington believed the "One man, One vote" and realized his dream by acting to his value. When you believe in something,
you should give your soul for this. And for this regard you need a great foundation with intellect motivated people who could run the world. But first you should define
your values.

### Rules vs Core Values
---
There is a quote by Gandhi said:
> Your beliefs become your thoughts,
>
>Your thoughts become your words,
>
>Your words become your actions,
>
>Your actions become your habits,
>
>Your habits become your values,
>
>And your values become your destiny

So what you found is derived from what you believe. If you do not think of it, you are going to downfall. The existence of your company has been established
by your core values. So as a founder, you should really care about them and ask yourself what is my core value. What do I really believe in.
Culture does not exist apart from the company itself. Culture is the mindset of the company.

There was a company that failed. They tried to provide best fashion clothes by means of artificial intelligence. They failed because when I saw them, they really
didn't care about fashion or their clothes. Surprisingly they expected to become a successful and they thought they failed because of the lack of knowledge!
This story might be humorous but the point is that the company does not exist apart from their people.

### The Destiny
---
The destiny is what you are living for. It's really hard to say you could detect what you are born for. Maybe there is a few people could say what are their destinies (If it'd true).
But thinking about the destiny is not out of favor. And in this regard

### Culture of Making
