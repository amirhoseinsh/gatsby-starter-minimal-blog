## Grow vs Scale

Linguists and widely human try to describe phenomena around with the language that we've developed.
The word "scale" has been popularized again in the last 20 years. In business, we use the "scale" or "scalable" alongside of the subjects related
to business, mostly technology-based businesses.
At the same time, we should notice there is a bit difference between this word and "grow". "Grow" merely use for showing that something increase, whereas
"scale" refers to increasing alongside with fixed infrastructure.

A PICTURE

When we speak about scaling in business, we mean exponential growth in revenue or profit and linear growth of resources.

Why does this word become more widespread?

## Misconception of Decentralization

Libertarian has a scaling problem. It's a flawed ideology. Societies always have tried to get closer to the ideal society where everyone could
buy or sold whatever they want. All the same, there've been always a supreme being entered when contradictions emerge as a divine judgement.
For this reason, I do not think Crypto will be survive at it's own way. Maybe this tech idea turn to something useful and compatible with human
nature like what happened with concept of NFT.

These happenings are so a like Poyais scheme by Gregor MacGregor when he tried to mount an aggressive sales campaign for selling a island
that does not even existed. People are afraid of long-term commitment and would be gulled if they'll gave a promise to be successful for making
just one smart decision. Scammers gain advantage from. So the fact that <b>most over-night successes took a long time</b> disappeared in their mind.
Unfortunately scammers persona are like entrepreneurs. Both try to encourage society to make a better decisions. But one of them abuse from society for a
short-term. The reason behind that is maybe scammers lack of creative thinking to make a real value and then sell it but entrepreneurs do vice versa.
Entrepreneurs also sell but people love them because when they create something, they make it available in a win-win context. They have more confidence
and they want a long relationship with society. Nonetheless, both of these types of people have selling and in fact scaling mindset.

So scaling is not related to chance, but to the people behind a philosophy of make something valuable available. The people who could think differently.
