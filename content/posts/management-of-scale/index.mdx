## Hunters
---
When we look at the nature, we may find out one of the common trait that any mammal has is the hunting for its existence.
These hunting could be segmented in two
sections, win-hunt and lose-hunt.
In the win-hunt circumestance, there is a <b>zero-sum game</b>, one side will always be a also-ran, however in the win-hunt, both sides will make the most of the interaction.
An example of a lose-hunt would be hunting for matter of nurturing. On the other hand, mating could be counted as a win-hunt as both parties are satisfied with the interaction that they have.

In human societies, win-lose games are not sustainable. The availability of information leads to the importance of something like reputation.
So win-win games are more desirable and sustainable than win-lose games. <b>The double thank-you of capitalism</b> shows that win-win games are more sustainable because
both sides are giver and taker at the moment. It's the primary benefit of free market. So when you think about hunting, you think about how could I get
benefit from existence of another person in a short and long run. Selling what you already have is the way you communicate with other to create a
value for yourself. When someone appreciate you and also you are happy with the satisfaction of that person, the double thank-you would be emerge.
If you offer, for instance, a cake to a customer, you will be thankful for the money that customer gives you and the customer is thankful for the
cake that you give to him.

As you try to sell, you should negotiate, and convince people that you have a great offer and could add a value. There are two main group of people that
are adept in the concept of selling, <b>Scammers</b> and <b>Entrepreneurs</b>.

## Scammers and Entrepreneurs
---
Politicians, journalists, programmers, athletes, and totally everyone try to sell and promote his value to the society. That's why you've been told find your talent and aptitude,
and then work hard on it. Because then you could sell these values to the society. All of us are sellers. The fact that people don't like salespeople is because selling
is more than its words. You are selling your experience, and people pay for it. It is also more than technical aspects of a software, it's about the experience that
it's users have. Even a nerd programmer tries to sell himself as a nerd.

Entrepreneurs and Scammers are good at this skill. As we look at history after (shayeste salari), entrepreneurs and inventors have had the most influence
on the society. As turkish economist Daron Acemoglu mentioned in his book Why Nation Fails, the correct mechanism for a society to give an advantage to its people based on the
value they create for their society. If you create 10 value, you will recieve 8, and not 12 or 2. And Entrepreneurs and Inventors create the most value for the
society. But another group of people that are good at selling are Scammers. They

These happenings are so a like Poyais scheme by Gregor MacGregor when he tried to mount an aggressive sales campaign for selling a island
that does not even existed. People are afraid of long-term commitment and would be gulled if they'll gave a promise to be successful for making
just one smart decision. Scammers know this fact and gain advantage from. So the fact that <b>most over-night successes took a long time</b> disappeared in their mind.
Unfortunately scammers persona are like entrepreneurs. Both try to encourage society to make a better decisions and buy a value that they create. But one of them abuse from society for a
short-term. The reason behind that is maybe scammers lack of creative thinking to make a real value and then sell it but entrepreneurs do vice versa.
Entrepreneurs also sell but people love them because when they create something, they make it available in a win-win context. They have more confidence
and they want a long relationship with society. Nonetheless, both of these types of people have selling and in fact scaling mindset.

## Fair Cake-Cutting Delusion
---
Libertarian has a scaling problem. It's a flawed ideology. Societies always have tried to get closer to the ideal society where everyone could
buy or sell whatever they want. All the same, there've been always a supreme being entered when contradictions emerge as a divine judgement.
When you want to divide fairly among a community, there are different perceptions of fairness. There are some approaches like proportion cutting that
help people to divide a cake. For example, for two people, divide and choose is the classic solution.
One person divides the resource into what they believe are equal halves,
and the other person chooses the "half" they prefer. The non-atomicity assumption guarantees that the cutter can indeed cut the cake to two equal pieces; the additivity
assumption guarantees that both partners value their pieces as at least 1/2.

But there will be some fallacies always there when you try to extend these models into the capital. When you want to distribute wealth,
it's not like to the distribution of something like weight of a person.
The distribution of the weight of a person is close to Gaussian Distribution with a low variance.
The probability of existence of a human with more than 300 kilogram weight is near to zero.
But when it comes to something like wealth, it has nothing common with weight. The variance is so high that you could not fit the Gaussian Distribution to it.
Nasim Nicolas Taleb argued that it is more like to Mandelbro Distribution. But with any distribution, this is may result of another thing, <b>thought</b>.
The thoughts of individuals has a great amount of difference, because they make different amount of value for their society. That's one of the reasons related to why communist countries had been failed.

Owing to these fact, we could not expect the same amount of skill among people for something like sales as it's one of the process of value proposition to the society. And
it's not fair I admit that but it exists and is very important.

## People Scale, Not Businesses
---
When I tried to write this article, the title was different. The title was related to why some companies turn to billion dollar companies and some of them failed over and over.
But when I started to write, I find out it has nothing to do with businesses, industries, or anything like that. it relates to people. So I changed the title.
Businesses and startups do not scale. Actually the founders make businesses take off. The team behind every successful product or idea make something scale.
People think that if there is a market, then your product will be successful, and if it doesn't you are going to downfall. But it's not true. Maybe there is a fascinating market, but what it is? It's a need,
and you should create a value for that. you should solve the need for something. So you need a great team, otherwise you wind up with a erratic situation and couldn't resist. And what if there is not the market that you
think exist? nothing happen if there is a good team. Slack team pivot from a game studio into a fast growing startup that do not related to their previous market.
Selling is one of the key attribute of scaling. If you could not propose your value, maybe there is no value there to propose and you are in a dreamy world. Selling is about knowing how human mind works.
And you create a value for humanity. So do not underestimate the sales as a part of your value.
