## Surface VS Deep Structure 

It's 18 January 2024, Open AI announced its market place 10 days ago,
however, users are not welcomed as the presentation by Sam Altman showed.

Another thing is that the concept was first introduced by Quora, the Poe, an
AI marketplace platform.

But it's just the surface, when we look at the data, microsoft pass the apple
as the most valuable company of the US.

What does it mean? 

One possibility is that its not the war of AI, it's a war about hardware,
and new architectures are just a mean to use the hardware, it's not a
new concept, hardware is sustainable, but for the matter of success in the field of
hardware you should offer the best possible service. 

That's why Microsoft buy Open AI. it's not because GPT-4 is the best 
language model (and it's not in many criteria). It's about it dictates
a compelling brand to all the end-users, so it worths to buy.
