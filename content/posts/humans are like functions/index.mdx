### The Philosophy
---

Humans try to segment the world into categories. Sometimes it might help. But sometimes it's dangerous.

You constantly gain new knowledge about how everything works. So sticking into the categories and models may cause biasing, and as a result,
may cause repetitive failure in the life.


### The Perception
---
As I mentioned, sometimes categorization and modeling help us to understand how things work. But it's only a perception. <b>The map is not the territory</b>.
Think about Newton Law, it's only a perception of how things work. not what exactly is. in quantum size, it's not helpful. But in the Newton era, it helped.

### When Problems Occur
---
In business, and in my country specifically, I saw people who was really interested in titles, rather than descriptions. A lot of people like job titles like <b>X Manager</b>. But it's only a perception.

I've seen many start-ups struggling with their job positions which result in company downfall. The CTO hadn't involved in marketing jobs, The Designer hadn't thought strategically, to name but a few.

What causes problems is only the perception. Titles give you the delusion of who you are, not who you exactly are.
People love titles. But it's not important. The output and success of your company is what truly is cherished.

### The Solution
---
When I was trying to gathering a great team for my start-up, I realized that job descriptions are more important than titles. In other words, titles does not even
have any worth and they just help the people outside of your company perceive the position of a person. So I introduce my teammate with a changing position title.
But everyone in the team has a great understanding of how she or he should work and what should be done.

It's the problem of language. In fact, it's problem of perceptions. When you say 'I Love you', every person has his own view of this statement.
Sometimes it is okay, but sometimes, as may perceptions differ, it would cause problems. But when you describe, or experience the sentence, it gives you
very helpful insights. When you experience Love, is totally different with just a word of 'Love'.


> At least, Descriptions give better insight of how things work, rather than Titles.
