### Fallacies
---
When it comes to biases, first we should define what are fallacies. Reasoning is the base of the language. Language is the one that makes us different from other
species. Reasoning helps us define what is truly work and what's not. Reasoning happens inside our head and we describe it by using the language, and as a result, arguments
beget. Fallacy is a wrong argument, the argument that does not work. It may be deceptive, manipulative or just mistaken because of having a dangling reasoning.

The most common breakdown of fallacies are formal and informal, Although there are other breakdowns like what Aristotle had done; linguistic and non-linguistic fallacies.
People sometimes underestimate the power of fallacy. We make fallacies in our routines. from simple to complex ones. But none of them are as harmful as the <b>oversimplification</b>.

### Oversimplification Fallacy
---
As cognitive science researchers suggested <sup>[1]</sup>,
the number of individual variables human can mentally handle while trying to solve a problem (like baking a lemon meringue pie) is relatively small:
Four variables are difficult; five are nearly impossible. So when it comes to success of Apple, people oversimplify a complex path to just success of one person.
As a result, people would miss the consequence of remove or add something from their daily life. Think about the Tesla, many believe that they produce cars with near to zero waste. But particle
pollution from electric cars could be worse than from diesel ones (Because of their emissions from wear of brakes compared with conventional vehicles).

In our era, the increasing availability of information lead us to simplify any complex structures. <b>Illusory truth effect</b> <sup>[2]</sup> lead us to believe there is one single
factor that cause something, without any further process. Repeated statements receive higher truth ratings than new statements, and then they become facts. For Hacking the non-improvement biases, we should
deep down to unknown statements and analyse them and then, accept them. Hopefully there are many valid sources and google also helps us to find trustworthier sources through its algorithm.


### Independent-Minded People
---
I got a lot of respect for Paul Graham, founder of Ycombinator. He uses the term of <b>Independent Mind</b> along with <b>Conventional Mind</b>. he claimed that
one of the most revealing ways to classify people is by the degree and aggressiveness of their conformism.
