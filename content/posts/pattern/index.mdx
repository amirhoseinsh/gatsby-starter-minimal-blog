### What is Pattern?
---

There are multiple definitions for the word "Pattern", But if we want to describe it at the abstract level, we could 
define a pattern as a regularity in the world, in human-made design, or in abstract ideas. As such, the elements of 
a pattern repeat in a predictable manner. 

In my perspective, patterns have impacted our everyday life. Every time we already solve a routine problem, we use our existing
patterns for solving the issue. For instance, I order a coffee in my brunch time to be more fresh. So the problem is freshing and 
the solution is ordering a coffee. That's a pattern that exists in my life.

## Pattern Language
---

grammar, semantic and syntax are part of the any language. So when we think of the pattern language, actually we think of 
patterns orderly specifies for each problem.
Christopher Alexander, one the greatest geniuses of our time, coined
the term "Pattern Language" and popularized by his 1977 book A Pattern Language. 
Christopher Alexander's work describes a process of decomposition, in which the designer has a problem (perhaps a commercial assignment), selects a solution, then discovers new, smaller problems resulting from the larger solution. I want to extend the philosophy of pattern language 
to all aspect of our lives. As Karim Rashid stated in his book "Design Your Self", we should face the problem in our life as a design problem. 

## Predictability is a Privilege
---

When we produce something, we leverage from our knowledge to do that. It's not an "one day achievement". 
the process of production takes time, not just when the process begins, but when the initiators were working on producing something else.
Although, no one could connect these dots looking forward, if we try to remember this concept in our steps, we 
could get the most benefit of choosing the path in our lives.
