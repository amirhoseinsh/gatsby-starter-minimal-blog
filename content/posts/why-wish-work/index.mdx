## Story, or maybe History
The story and history have a common stem `historia`. I do not know what I should name this section, but it doesn't matter, as it's a narrative of my context as a person.

Like all other men, I belong to a specified period of time and, I was born in a specific country. Iran, as we all know, is experiencing hard times in its history.
We are not divided from our ancestors, and that's why history is so important. In my region, people don't pay enough attention to it, and even if they do, they
have lacked the power of reasoning as they have not been educated for functioning in this manner. 

## There would be no Outlier

## From Experience to Scale

## Chronophobia is a Delusion

## I will, therefore I am
