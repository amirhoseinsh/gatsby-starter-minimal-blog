The Reason
</Text>

---
I totally have a passion for writing.

It's part of my hobbies. In this blog, I try to share my thoughts about anything that I care. I'm fascinated by entrepreneurship.

The reason behind why some determined people make an enormous effort to solve unsolvable problems is always marvelous for me. There maybe some scientists, mathematician, or
physician who solved or is solving complex problems. I respect them. I mean it. But I think that the problems that relate to humans nature is more complex. In business, as in war,
you may face a situation with undetermined equations with quite a few variables. You cannot even determine the amount of variables. And in this regard, I respect a lot for entrepreneurship.


As an entrepreneur, I [experienced, is experiencing] interesting things that might be helpful. And maybe, in near future, these posts would be helpful, at least for myself, as I could look backward and connect the dots of my career.
