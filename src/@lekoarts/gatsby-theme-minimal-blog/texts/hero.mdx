The Reason
</Text>

I totally have a passion for writing.

It's part of my hobbies. In this blog, I try to share my thoughts about anything that I care. I'm fascinated by entrepreneurship.

The reason behind why some determined people make an enormous effort to solve unsolvable problems is always marvelous for me. There maybe some scientists, mathematician, or physician who

solved or is solving complex problems. I respect them. But I think that the problems that relate to human nature is more complex. So I respect a lot for entrepreneurship.


As an entrepreneur in Iran, I saw interesting things that might be helpful for the people who may face with them or the people who want to get to know more about struggles that someone maybe face during these processes. And maybe, in near future, these posts would be helpful, at least for myself, as I could look backward and connect the dots of my career.
